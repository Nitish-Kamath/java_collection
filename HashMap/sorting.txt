There is no ordering in hashmap.
we can sort on the basis of key and values.
sorting on the basis of key:-
TreeMap
LinkedHashMap
Algo for TreeMap:-
We use TreeMap constructor to sort the elements and pass the object of Hashmap class as an argument.
Algo for LinkedHashMap:-
get key set
convert set into list
sort the list
add sorted list into LinkedHashMap

LINKEDHASHMAP GURANTEES THE INSERTION ORDER OF MAPPINGS.

We cannot use TreeMap to sort values because TreeMap sorts elements by Keys.
