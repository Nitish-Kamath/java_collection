few points:-
dynamic array
like vector in c++
size can be modified
found in java.util package
implents list interface
memory is allocated in random fashion
manipulation is slower bcz of shifting 
need to use Wrapper class for creation like Integer, String,Character
ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>();
NOTE:- remember to import java.util.*; to use all functionality of collection
ArrayList cannot store primitives rather it store object data type (like integer object )
alist.add(10) -> alist.add(integer.valueOf(10)) 
But Array can store primitives as well as objects
